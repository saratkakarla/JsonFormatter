# To run the program.
cd JsonFormatter
java -cp target/classes:target/classes/gson-2.8.6.jar JsonFormatUtils <json_file_name>

# Example: java -cp target/classes:target/classes/gson-2.8.6.jar JsonFormatUtils /tmp/test1.json

# TODO list:

1. Present code is only for demonstration purposes, this may not work for the large json objects as they need more memory. 
   To make it work with large objects Gson's TypeAdapter with JsonReader can be used.
2. Add more +v and -ve tests to process various sizes of the JSON object
